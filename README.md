# Labstep API examples

This repository contains a handful of python scripts using the Labstep API.

### Further details

We use the same API for our web app so anything you can do on the web app you can do via the api! To see how the web app does it, open the developer tools in your browser, go to the network tab and search for network requests sent to `api.labstep.com`
